The commentary starts from 2.10.","scetdss":"1.351.44Nihatya etc. upto anususruma. Sin alone is the agent in the act of slaying these desperadoes. Therefore here the idea is this : These ememies of ours have been slain, i.e., have been take possession of, by sin. Sin would come to us also after slaying them. Sin in this context is the disregard, on account of greed etc., to the injurious conseences like the ruination of the family and the like. That is why Arjuna makes a specific mention of the [ruin of the] family etc., and of its duties in the passage How by slaying my own kinsmen etc.\nThe act of slaying, undertaken with an individualizing idea about its result, and with a particularizing idea about the person to be slain, is a great sin. To say this very thing precisely and to indicate the intensity of his own agony, Arjuna says only to himself [see next sloka]:","scetssa":"1.26 - 1.47 Arjuna said - Sanjaya saidSanjaya continued:The high-minded Arjuna, extremely kind, deeply friendly, and supremely righteous, having brothers like himself, though repeatedly deceived by the treacherous attempts of your people like burning in the lac-house etc., and therefore fit to be killed by him with the help of the Supreme Person, nevertheless said, I will not fight.\nHe felt weak, overcome as he was by his love and extreme compassion for his relatives. He was also filled with fear, not knowing what was righteous and what unrighteous. His mind was tortured by grief, because of the thought of future separation from his relations. So he threw away his bow and arrow and sat on the chariot as if to fast to death.","chakravarthi":"But it is said:\nagnido garadas caiva sastra-panir dhanapahah ksetra-darapahari ca sad ete hy atatayinah\nThe arsonist, one who poisons, one who attacks with weapons, the thief, the stealer of property and the stealer of ones wife are considered aggressors. Vasistha Smrti 3.19\nAnd also it is said:\natatayinam ayantarh hanyad evavicarayan natatayi-vadhe doso hantur bhavati kascana\nWithout consideration, one should kill the aggressors, as there is no fault in killing them. Manu Smrti 8.350\nThus the scriptures prescribe killing in the case of aggressors.\nArjuna answers with this verse. Killing them, we will remain, but we will be sinful. The above instructions are from artha sastra, but those instructions are weaker than those from dharma sastra. Yajnavalkya says:\nsmrtyor virodhe nyayas tu balavan vyavaharatah artha-sastrat tu balavan dharma-sastram iti sthitih\nIt is established that where there is conflict of rules in two smrti statements, reasoning must prevail of customs to choose the correct rule. However, in reasoning, the rules of dharma sastra are stronger than those of artha sastra. Yajnavalkya Smrti 2.21\nThus though they are aggressors they are also acaryas. In killing acaryas, we will incur sin. We cannot also be happy in this life or the next, since the act is against the rules of dharma and against the conclusion of reasoning. Thus he says “How can we be happy, having killed our own people?”","rudra":"\nIt may be argued to Arjuna that if he doesnotslayhisenemiesdueto\nfeeling compassion for them, then they out ofgreedforpowertheywill\nsurely slay him; therefore it would be betterforhimtoslaythemand\nenjoy sovereignty. This is answered in a verse and a half beginning with:I\ndo not like etc. Even if they kill us I do not like to killthemevenfor\nattaining the sovereignty of all the threeworldsmuchlessforgaining\nonly this earth.\nThe Vedic scriptures declare that those who commit the followingsixtypes\nof crimes being : arson, poisoning, assaulting with weapons,stealingones\nwealth, usurping ones land orkidnappingoneswifeareaggressorsand\nDuryodhana and the Kauravas were definitelyaggressorshavingcommitted\nall six offences against the Pandavas beginning with arson. Theslayingof\naggressors is justifiable and the Vedic scripturesstatethatoneshould\nslay an aggressor coming with the intention ofcommittingacriminalact\nwithout hesitation and that the slayer of such an aggressorincursnosin\nwhatsoever. This is being answered by the verse and a halfbeginningwith:\nsin alone etc. The text which states one shouldkillbelongstowhatis\ncalled an Artha Sastra which is a scripture dealing with the rules andlaws\nregarding wealth. Artha Sastra is considered less authoritative thanDharma\nSastra which arescriptures dealing with righteousness.DharmaSastrais\nsuperior to Artha Sastra. As it is stated by the sage Yagnavalkya: whentwo\nscriptures differ the one whose conclusion is the most reasonableandmost\nlogical is to be considered superior. This is theunderstanding.Therefore\nby the slaying of preceptors etc. although they areaggressors,Arjunais\nstating that sin shall be incurred because such slaying isunwarrantedand\nunrighteous. There can be no happiness from this. This isbeinggivenby:\nHow can we adopt this course of action?\nAlthough Duryodhana and the Kauravasbeing deprived of all discrimination\nare determined to fight; why should we who are not deprived of\ndiscrimination become degraded as well by such sinfulness? We should\nresolve not to engage in this battle.\nIt may be argued that the action of slaying kinsman is commontoboththe\nPandavas andtheKauravas;soevenastheKauravasadoptingsucha\ncontingency are determined to fight; it is betterforArjunatolikewise\nengage himself in the battle, what is thevalueofdespondency?Thisis\nbeing answered by these two verses.","brahma":"\nMadhvacarya has no commentary so we present Baladeva Vidyabhusanas.\nIf the question arises that although it is advisableforthePandavasto\nengage in battle being challenged by their enemies the Kauravasbecauseit\nis well known that a ksatriya can never decline a challenge to fightorto\ngamble. To answer this Arjuna speaks the versebeginning:yadyapyetena\npasyanti and the verse beginning katham na jneyam asmabhih. Thereasonfor\nthe Kauravas to be engaged in war is out of greed.Whereaswenothaving\nthis desire of greed therefore have no desire for battle. One is engagedin\nkarmic activities to fulfil ones desires;butonlyifnonegativityis\ncreated and the action results intotalhappinesscanitbeconsidered\nrighteousness.\nIt is also described in the codes of warfare that a Syen Yaga isprescribed\nfor killing of ones enemies. Although it is true because theresultofit\nwill not give happiness tothefamilymembersofthedeceased,itis\nunreasonable for us to be engaged in this battle.Ontheotherhandthe\ntradition of accepting a challenge by ksatriyas is applicable when thereis\nno probabilityofdestructionofthedynasty.Arjunaagainaddresses\nLord Krishna again asJanardana,HewhoalwaysnaturallyprotectsHis\ndevotees, Arjuna is intimating that since Lord Krishna is theSupremeLord\nand has appeared for the express purpose of removing allthoseopposedto\nrighteousness on the Earth, He can just by His will destroy all theenemies\neffortlessly Himself.","shri":"There is no commentary for this verse.","kumar":"Why are they trying to kill the Pandavas in the firstplacemightnowbe\nasked?
