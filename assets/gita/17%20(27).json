And even the action meant for these is, verily, called as sat (good). ","etssa":"17.27 Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and gift, is also called Sat and also action in connection with these (or for the sake of the Supreme) is called Sat. ","etdss":"17.27. The steadfastness is performing sacrifice, in austerity and in giving gift is also called SAT; and also the act for such purpose is [hence] just called SAT.

If you do them in the name and for the sake of Brahman you will attain perfection and supreme peace of the Absolute.If you pin your faith on the glory and power of this name Om or Om Tat Sat? you will be freed from the bondage of birth and death. If you perform any sacrifice? austerity or charity or any action in a selfless and motiveless spirit? surrendering all the actions and their rewards to the Lord and if you utter the word Sat with faith? feeling and devotion? you will attain perfection and success in the action.Even the imperfect and nonSattvic acts of sacrifice? austerity and gift will be turned into perfect and Sattvic ones.These Sacrifice? austerity and gift. ","scetsga":"17.27 And sthitih, steadfastness; that is yajne, in sacrifice, in the act of sacrifice; the steadfastness that is tapasi, in austerity; and the steadfastness that is dane, in charity; that ucyate, is spoken of; sat iti, as sat, by learned persons. And eva, even; the karma, action; tad-arthiyam, meant for these-for sacrifice, charity and austerity, or for Him whose names are under discussion, i.e. for God; is eva, verily; abhidhiyate, called; sat iti, as sat (good).\nThus, in this way, the acts of sacrifice, austerity, etc., even when they are devoid of sattva and goodness, become good and endued with sattva by he use of the three names of Brahman with faith.\nAnd as regards those (sacrifice etc.), since in all cases everything is performed with a predominance of faith, therefore- ","scetdss":"17.23-27 Om etc. upto abhidhiyate. An indication of the Brahman i.e., an act of facing (or aiming at) the Brahman is made by these three words viz., OM, TAT and SAT. Of them, Om indicates that This purport of the scriptures is [to be ?] accepted as long as one has bodily connection.\n \nThe pronoun TAT, which denotes generality and which is incapable of denoting exclusively a particular, mentions, as far as the Brahman is concerned, the absence of intention for fruit. An intention is not possible without reference to something particular. No doubt [TAT] may denote all particulars [in general]. But it would lead to intending the fruits and the doer-ship with regard to all [in general]. Even then [the Brahman] cannot have connection with any particular fruit.\n \nThe Vedic word SAT denotes prasie. The act, like this sacrifice etc., though perormed, truns out to be an act of the Tams (evil act) if it is performed with the idea, It is an evil act. Further, what is performed with an intention for a particular fruit is not praiseworthy, and it causes nothing but bondage. Therefore, those, who bear in mind, This is a thing to be performed - they are not fettered, even though they perform acts like sacrifice etc. With this idea only, it has been said in the Adiparvan as -\n \nThe austerity is not dirt, nor the [Vedic] study, nor the natural ritual enjoined by the Vedas, and nor the act of earning wealth by all efforts. But, if they are struck by mind, they themselves become dirt.\n(MB, Adi. i, 210).\n \n[Here in this passage] dirt that which fetters. Natural : [That is, ordained ], such as -\n \nWithout expecting anything, a Brahman should learn the Vedas etc., together with their six subsidiaries etc.\n \nBy all effort : by the act that is suitable and is well known in the scriptures and in the worldly practice. By mind : by the mind that is yoked to the traid of the Strands, Sattva etc. [Those actions that] have been simply ruined [by that mind], are binding and not otherwise. This is the idea here.\n \nTherefore, the acts like sacrifice etc., and the acts, like aciring [Wealth] etc., for that purpose, have to be perfored as being inevitable as long as the body exists.\n \nOr, perhaps, the word OM conveys [with regard to the Brahman] the idea of That in Which the entire universe has been totally calmed down. TAT conveys the idea of That of the nature of Sovereign Independence of Will, which is nothing but comprehending the rising waves in the form of the universe. And the word SAT denotes the act of manifestation by the Brahman - even though It is complete in Itself - as [the universe] having varied nature, a manifestation that causes differences (or duality) expanding under the weight of its Sovereign Independenc of Will. Hence it has been said In the sense of manifesting as beings and in the sense of manifesting perfectly [SAT is employed]. Thus, having is front [as a casue] that aspect (the Soul) of highly tranil nature; and having in the centre that aspect which is well connected with desire-waves viz., the desire to make gift, the desire to perform sacrifice and the desire to observe penance; this final body radiates (or dances) filled with a group of activities, such as offering gift, performing sacrifice and observing austerity, and of what are conducive to them. This triad is indeed simultaneously the inherent nature of the Unhindered One (the Soul). So, what fruit could be there ? And to whom ? How ? Whence ? Where ? And by what means ? \n The act of person, with no faith, is an act of the Tamas and bears no fruit in any way and bears fruit which is nothing but the labour undertaken in bringing together the band of means [of those acts]. Hence one should not on any account remain faithless. This is being said now : ","scetssa":"17.27 Therefore, devotion of persons of the first three stations who follow the Vedas in respect of sacrifices, austerities and gifts is called Sat, since it is auspicious. So the Vedas, Vedic acts and the three stations, expressed by the term brahmana, since they are characterised by their connection with the words Om Tat Sat, are to be distinguished from what are not the Vedas and Vedic. ","chakravarthi":" ","rudra":"\nThe auspiciousness of the word SAT is being glorified by Lord Krishna. SAT\nis the sound vibration representing the brahman or spiritual substratum\npervading all existence and to exemplify eternal goodness and the purity of\ncreation. For any Vedic rite enjoined to be performed under the ordinances\nand injunctions of the Vedic scriptures by authorised Vaisnavas and\nbrahmanas; SAT will also be vibrated in conjunction with OM and TAT.\nSteadiness and concentration in yagnas or propitiation and worship is also\ndeemed as SAT. All activities directly performed for the satisfaction of\nthe Supreme Lord such as collection of articles for offering like ghee or\nclarified butter from a cow, sweeping and cleaning the temple of the\nSupreme Lord, singing devotional songs in glorification of the Supreme\nLord, making flower garlands for Lord Krishna or any authorised incarnation\nand expansion as revealed in Vedic scriptures, etc. All these direct\nactivities are deemed as SAT. Even indirect activities that assist in\naccomplishing the direct activities such as establishing flower gardens and\nagricultural fields, harvesting fruits, rice and grains, acquiring wealth\nto be donated to the Vaisnava brahmana devotees of the Supreme Lord\nKrishna, all these indirect activities are also deemed to be SAT. Therefore\nsince OM TAT SAT are transcendental nomenclatures connected to the Supreme\nLord and eternally auspicious they are recited at all Vedic rites by duly\ninitiated Vaisnavas and brahmanas from one of the four sampradayas or\nauthorised channels of disciplic succession as revealed in Vedic scriptures\nand by their efficacy perfect any defects or errors. To consider SAT as\nonly a mere laudatory evocation is not consistent with the ultimate\nreality. SAT denotes creation, the eternal existence of the atma or\nimmortal soul and perpetual goodness. SAT is understood to be an injunction\nwith the maxim: SAT is eternally auspicious and always to be praised,\nhonoured and glorified. ","brahma":"\nThe word SAT denotes creation and eternal goodness. The pranava refers to\nthe first breath OM which is vibrated at the commencement of all Vedic\nrites from the root word prana meaning breath. Properly pronouncing the\npranava OM as AH--OOOH--MMMMM while comprehensively understanding its\nmeaning without the slightest desire for rewards, by performing yagnas or\npropitiation and worship to the Supreme Lord with devotion and tapah or\nausterities and danam or charity as matter of duty, by japa chanting the\nholy names of the Supreme Lord Krishna:\nHare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare\nHare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare\nWith great respect and love as well as the names of any of His authorised\nincarnations and expansions as revealed in Vedic scriptures are all\nconsidered SAT. Thus by duly initiated Vaisnava brahmanas evoking the\nsacred sound vibrations OM TAT SAT, the Supreme Lord is verily propitiated\nand worshipped. The Rig Veda confirms that yagnas that are performed for the exclusive\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord without the slightest trace for\nexpectation of rewards and are designated OM TAT SAT. The Vedas call these\nthree divine sounds the performers of Vedic rites due to the fact that the\npotency of vibrating OM TAT SAT perfects any defects, insures success and\npleases the Supreme Lord granting communion with Him. ","shri":" The Supreme Lord Krishna explains that the word SAT denotes eternal\nexistence and perpetual goodness. The words sad-bhave exemplifies eternal\nexistence and the words sadhu-bhave exemplifies perpetual goodness. This\nis the correct understanding in which SAT is to be comprehended in the\nVedas as well as its utilisation by the recitation of SAT in prescribed\nVedic rituals performed exclusively by the Vaisnavas and brahmanas.\nSimilarly the transcendental sound of SAT may be evoked for any auspicious\nactivity ordained by the Vedic scriptures by duly initiated Vaisnava\nbrahmanas in any of the 480,000 types of humans existing throughout\ncreation. To follow the prescribed Vedic duties of yagna or propitiation and worship\nby the Vaisnava brahmanas, tapah or austerities by the ksatriyas the royal\nwarrior class and danam or charity by the vaisyas or merchant class are all\nconsiderd in sattva guna or mode of goodness because they are\nconscientiously following the ordinances and injunctions of the Vedic\nscriptures. Thus all such activities are known as SAT denoting perpetual\ngoodness and due to being dedicated to the Supreme Lord they possess\nauspicious attributes of an eternal nature and for this they are also known\nas SAT. Thus the relationship of OM TAT SAT to the Vedas, the performance of\nprescribed Vedic activities performed by Vaisnava brahmanas and protected\nby the ksatriyas while supported by the vaisyas clearly and succinctly\ndemonstrates what is factually Vedic in society and what is actually\nsituated in sattva guna while simultaneously clarifying comprehensively by\nthe logic of opposing parallels what is not Vedic in society and thus\ndoomed to the perdition of exclusion from the ascending orbit of sattva\nguna.
