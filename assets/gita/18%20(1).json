This last discourse is a brief masterly summary of all that is told in the previous chapters. Arjuna wishes to know the distinction between Sannyasa and Tyaga.Kesi was an Asura whom Lord Krishna slew. So? Lord Krishna is addressed as Kesinishudana by Arjuna.The words Sannyasa and Tyaga have been used here and there in the preceding discourses? but their connotations are not lucidly distinguished. Therefore Lord Krishna clearly explains to Arjuna the right significance of the two terms in the following verse. ","scetsga":"18.1 O mighty-armed Hrsikesa, kesi-nisudana, O slayer of (the demon) Kesi; icchami, I want; veditum, to know; prthak, severally, through their mutual distinctions; tattvam, the truth, the intrinsic nature, i.e. the real meaning; sannyasasya, of sannyasa, i.e. the meaning of the word sannyasa, ca, as also; tyagasya, of tyaga, i.e. the meaning of the word tyaga.\nKesi was a demon who had assumed the form of a horse, and Lord Vasudeva had killed him. Hence He is addressed by that name (Kesi-nisudana) by Arjuna.\nThe word sannyasa and tyaga, used in various places in the preceding chapters, are not explicit in their implications. Therefore, in order to determine them for Arjuna who had put the estion,- ","scetdss":"18.1 Samnyasaya etc. It has been delcared earlier that He [alone] is a man of relinishment and is also a man of wisdom (II, 50); and He [alone] is a man of renunciation and a man of Yoga; but not he who remains without his fires (VI, 1), and so on. Thus, becuase a man of relinishment and a man of renunciation are both found mentioned, now arises this estion from a person (Arjuna) who is desirous of understanding their difference. \n Now [by giving] the answer - ","scetssa":"18.1 Arjuna said Both Sannyasa and Tyaga as a means for release are enjoined in such Srutis: Not by rituals, nor by progeny, nor by rituals, nor by progeny, nor by wealth but by Tyaga alone do some attain immortality ৷৷. (Ma. Na., 5.14). Ascertaining the truth about the Supreme Reality from a knowledge of Vedanta, and becoming purified in mind by the means of Sannyasa Yoga, these Yatis (ascetics), at the dissolution of their bodies, attain the Lord who is higher than the freed selves and become liberated from bondage (Man. U., 3.2.6). I want to know separately the truth, viz., whether Tyaga and Sannyasa are synonymous or not. The import is this. Do these two terms Sannyasa and Tyaga have different meanings or do they signify the same thing? If they signify different things, I want to know their different natures. If they are synonymous, their identical nature should be elucidated. Then, in order to prove that the nature of both is identical and that it is such and such, the Lord explains, showing the disagreements among some disputants: ","chakravarthi":"The eighteenth chapter speaks of the three types of sannyasa, jnana and karma, defines liberation and indicates bhakti as the highest secret of all.\n“You stated in the previous chapter ‘Uttering the word tat, without seeking results, sacrifices, austerities and charities are performed by those with desire for liberation from the atat material world.’ Those with a desire for liberation are sannyasis. But there seems to be others who are detached from all the results of their work, as mentioned by you when you said sarva-karma-phala-tydgam tatah kuru yatatmavan: give up all the result of your work with great attention. (BG 12.11) What is the tyaga of these others?” Wanting to know the distinction, Arjuna asks a question in this verse.\n“If the words sannyasa and tydga have different meanings I desire to know the distinct essence of these two. But if they mean the same thing, in your opinion or others’ opinion, I desire to know what is that one meaning as well.\n“O controller of the senses (hrsikesa), you have made this doubt arise in me since you are the instigator of my intelligence. O killer of Kesi (kesi nisudana), you kill this doubt of mine just as you killed Kesi. O Mighty-armed one (maha baho), you have great strength in your arms, and I have insignificant strength in my arms. You have become friendly with such an expansion as me, rather than with your other expansions with vast knowledge. Therefore I am not afraid to ask this question, since you have become somewhat friendly with me.” ","rudra":"\nIn order to ascertain exactly what is the final conclusion of all the\nteachings and instructions that have been imparted up until now; the\nSupreme Lord Krishna concisely summarises the entire Bhagavad-Gita in this\nconcluding chapter by clearly distinguishing the difference between\nrenunciation of actions caused by the impulses of desire and renunciation\nof the desire for rewards for ones actions. In previous chapters Lord\nKrishna has elaborated on the mental renunciation of all actions in chapter\n5, verse 13 as well as renunciation of actions through yoga or the\nindividual consciousness attaining communion with the ultimate\nconsciousness in chapter 9, verse 28. He has also explained renouncing\nattachment to actions while renouncing their rewards in chapter 4, verse 20\nand likewise explained the renunciation of the rewards resulting from\nactions in chapter 12, verse 11. It should be understood that the\ninfinitely merciful and totally omniscient Supreme Lord Krishna never\nteaches or exemplifies contradictory knowledge. Whatever and wherever His\ndivine lila or pastimes are manifesting they are always perfection and the\nepitome of dharma or eternal righteousness. Everything He does or expounds\nupon whether instructional or by example is always fully harmonious with\nthe Vedas and in completely complimentary to the conclusions of all the\nVedic scriptures. So to distinctly know the difference between renunciation\nof performing actions and to reconcile it harmoniously with renunciation\nfor the results of actions is the poignant and penetrating question\nrequested to be answered here.
