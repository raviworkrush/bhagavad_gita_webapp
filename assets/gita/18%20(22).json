That [instrument-of-knowledge], because of which, one, not realising the whole, gets indulged, without reason, in a particular activity, and which is unconcerned with the real nature of things and is insignificant - that is declared to be of the Tamas (Strand).

Some regard that Isvara is a mere piece of stone or wood. Such knowledge is really not based on reason. It does not see things in their true light. It is narrow (Alpam) as it is not founded on reason. It produces very small results too. It extends over a limited area and is not allcomprehensive. This knowledge is said to be Tamasic? as it is found in Tamasic persons who are devoid of the power of discrimination. ","scetsga":"18.22 But tat, that knowledge; is udahrtam, said to be; tamasam, born of tamas; yat, which is; saktam, confined; ekasmin, to one; karye, from, to one body or to an external image etc., krtsnavat, as though it were all, as though it comprehended everything, thinking, The Self, or God, is only this much; there is nothing beyond it,-as the naked Jainas hold that the soul conforms to and has the size of the body, or (as others hold) that God is merely a stone or wood-, remaining confined thus to one form; ahaitukam, which is irrational, bereft of logic; a-tattvarthavat, not concerned with truth-tattvartha, truth, means some-thing just as it is; that (knowledge) which has this (truth) as its object of comprehension is tattvarthavat; that without this is ; a-tattvarthavat-; and which, on account of the very fact of its being irrational, is alpam, trivial, because it is concerned with trifles or is productive of little result. This kind of knowledge is indeed found in non-discriminating creatures in whom tamas predominates.\nNow is being stated the threehold division of action: ","scetdss":"18-20-22 Sarvabhutesu etc. upto samudahrtam. In the classified ones : i.e., [classified] as gods, human beings, etc. Considers as [really] different : i.e., with the thought Here on this depends my pleasure; here in that lies my displeasure. Without reason : To take recourse to wrath, desire etc., slavishly under the influence of ones own addiction and also without examining the cause, in named as a thing born of the Tamas (Strand). ","scetssa":"18.22 But that knowledge which clings to a single type of act as what ought to be done, viz., act in the form of the worship of ghosts or evil spirits yielding very small fruits, as if it yielded all fruits; that work not founded on any reason for having attachment, because it is not a source of all fruits; untrue because it is based on a false view of things such as seeing differentiation in the nature of the Atman; insignificant, because the worship of ghosts and evil spirits yields poor results - for such reasons knowledge of this kind is declared to be Tamasika. After having thus classified the threefold division of knowledge relating to work according to Gunas in respect of a person who is alified for work, Sri Krsna explains the triple division of the acts that ought to be done, according to Gunas. ","chakravarthi":"This verse speaks of tamasic knowledge. Knowledge which is speculative only (ahaitukam) (not with reference to any scripture) which is extremely attached to performing one material activity such as eating or bathing, drinking or enjoying with a woman, with disregard for vedic activities like sacrifice, with no idea of real truth (atattva arthavat), knowledge which is scant like that of an animal, is known as tamasic knowledge.\nKnowledge of tat which is different from the body is sattvika. Knowledge of scriptures of logic and such, which gives rise to various doctrines, is rajasic. Knowledge, which is only of bathing, eating and other material actions, is tamasic. This is a summary of the three types of knowledge. ","rudra":"\nHere Lord Krishna explains that knowledge in tama guna or mode of ignorance\nis limited to the singular idea of bodily conception as if the physical\nbody is the actual identity of the jiva or embodied being. Animals which\nare driven by instinct are possessed with this ignorance. But believing\nthat the physical body is the be all an end all is not consciousness and is\nfallacious and irrational without any connection to reality. Therefore such\na misconception is irrelevant and inconsequential because of possessing an\nextremely limited scope of existence and hence produces paltry and meagre\nresults. Such knowledge is in tama guna. ","brahma":"\nObstinately clinging to ones limited viewpoint without considering the\nvision of others is a symptom of tama guna the mode of ignorance. Also if\none supposes that after acquiring wisdom and thereafter achieving moksa or\nliberation from material existence that a jiva or embodied is independent\nwhen in reality even a liberated being is completely dependent and\nsubservient to the Supreme Lord, this conception would be a great offence\nand cause demerits. Again assuming that nothing exists beyond the jiva or\nembodied being and what one perceives is illusory and unmeritorious. What\nneed then is there to emphasise the fact that the acquisition of illogical\nhypothesis and untenable suppositions is a source of great degradation. Now begins the summation. Irrational consciousness obtained from distorted and perverse conceptions\nfar removed from perceptions of the ultimate truth have no benefit for\nanyone in this life or the next and are fully situated in tama guna. There\nis an aphorism that knowledge must be received from a proper source in the\nproper order. This being the case there is no necessity in itemising\ndegraded and depraved conceptions. The cause for such degradation of\nconsciousness is miniscule knowledge and limited understanding which\nconsequently develops acute unawareness. For a jiva to think of themselves\nas omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent on the same level as the Supreme\nLord or entertain the illusion that they are the same as the Supreme Lord\nis the height of folly and completely devoid of all rationality and common\nsense. Such erroneous conclusions which stem from irrational consciousness\ndeprives actual knowledge of its elevated position and is always immersed\nin tama guna. It is seen that those who follow teachings, beliefs,\ndoctrines and philosophies opposed to the eternal and imperishable Vedic\nscriptures are primarily mayavadis or impersonalists whose religions are\ndesigned in such a way that they are bereft of any actual conception of the\nSupreme Lord to comprehend and so they either follow a creationist\nconception without purpose or a concoct a supreme being without qualities\nand attributes. ","shri":"\nOne who clings to a single activity in a stagnant and obstinate manner such\nas the worship of an impersonal conception of God and considers that such\nan insignificant activity has the highest perfection in existence to the\nexclusion of all other possibilities and not considering any other\nconception as tenable and in stagnation ceases to develop and grow is the\nepitome of one shackled in tama guna. The word ahaitakam means irrational,\nwithout reason, imagining that which gives meagre results to give great\nresults. The words attatva-arthavat means devoid of reality, without\nsubstantiation of the Vedic scriptures. The word alpan means limited in\nscope and relates to foolish, trivial pagan acts such as worshiping ghosts\nand spirits for material power. So thus showing how the three gunas or\nmodes of material nature have a direct effect on the knowledge possessed by\nthe performer of any action; Lord Krishna will next expound upon their\ndirect influence upon actions themselves.
