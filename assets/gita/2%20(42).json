They are highly enamoured of such Vedic passages which prescribe ways for the attainment of heavenly enjoyments. They say that there is nothing else beyond the sensual enjoyments in Svarga (heaven) which can be obtained by performing the rites of the Karma Kanda of the Vedas.There are two main divisions of the Vedas -- Karma Kanda (the section dealing with action) and Jnana Kanda (the section dealing with knowledge). The Karma Kanda comprises the Brahmanas and the Samhitas. This is the authority for the Purvamimamsa school founded by Jaimini. The followers of this school deal with rituals and prescribe many of them for attaining enjoyments and power here and happiness in heaven. They regard this as the ultimate object of human existence. Ordinary people are attracted by their panegyrics. The Jnana Kanda comprises the Aranyakas and the Upanishads which deal with the nature of Brahman or the Supreme Self.Life in heaven is also transitory. After the fruits of the good actions are exhausted? one has to come back to this earthplane. Liberatio or Moksha can only be attained by knowledge of the Self but not by performing a thousand and one sacrifices.Lord Krishna assigns a comparatively inferior position to the doctrine of the Mimamsakas of performing Vedic sacrifices for obtaining heaven? power and lordship in this world as they cannot give us final liberation.","scetsga":"2.42 Partha, O son of Prtha; those devoid of one-pointed conviction, who pravadanti, utter; imam, this; yam puspitam vacam, flowery talk, which is going to be stated, which is beautiful like a tree in bloom, pleasant to hear, and appears to be (meaningful) sentences [Sentences that can be called really meaningful are only those that reveal the self.-Tr.]; who are they? they are avipascitah, people who are undiscerning, of poor intellect, i.e. non-discriminating; veda-vada-ratah, who remain engrossed in the utterances of the Vedas, in the Vedic sentences which reveal many panegyrics, fruits of action and their means; and vadinah, who declare, are apt tosay; iti, that; na anyat, nothing else [God, Liberation, etc.]; asti, exists, apart from the rites and duties conducive to such results as attainment of heaven etc.\nAnd they are kamatmanah, have their minds full of desires, i.e. they are swayed by desires, they are, by nature, full of desires; (and) svarga-parah, have heaven as the goal. Those who accept heaven (svarga) as the supreme (para) human goal, to whom heaven is the highest, are svarga-parah. They utter that speech ( this is supplied to construct the sentence ) which janma-karma-phala-pradam, promises birth as a result of rites and duties. The result (phala) of rites and duties (karma) is karma-phala. Birth (janma) itself is the karma-phala. That (speech) which promises this is janma-karma-phala-prada. (This speech) is kriya-visesa-bahulam, full of various special rites; bhoga-aisvarya-gatim-prati, for the attainment of enjoyment and affluence. Special (visesa) rites (kriya) are kriya-visesah. The speech that is full (bahula) of these, the speech by which that is full (bahula) of these, the speech by which these, viz objects such as heaven, animals and sons, are revealed plentifully, is kriya-visesa-bahula. Bhoga, enjoyment, and aisvarya, affluence, are bhoga-aisvarya. Their attainment (gatih) is bhoga-aisvarya-gatih. (They utter a speech) that is full of the specialized rites, prati, meant for that (attainment). The fools who utter that speech move in the cycle of transmigration. This is the idea.","scetdss":"2.42 See Comment under 2.44","scetssa":"2.42 - 2.44 The ignorant, whose knowledge is little, and who have as their sole aim the attainment of enjoyment and power, speak the flowery language i.e., having its flowers (show) only as fruits, which look apparently beautiful at first sight. They rejoice in the letter of the Vedas i.e., they are attached to heaven and such other results (promised in the Karma-kanda of the Vedas). They say that there is nothing else, owing to their intense attachment to these results. They say that there is no fruit superior to heaven etc. They are full of worldly desires and their minds are highly attached to secular desires. They hanker for heaven, i.e. think of the enjoyment of the felicities of heaven, after which one can again have rirth which offers again the opportunity to perform varied rites devoid of true knowledge and leads towards the attainment of enjoyments and power once again.\nWith regard to those who cling to pleasure and power and whose understanding is contaminated by that flowery speech relating to pleasure and lordly powers, the aforesaid mental disposition characterised by resolution, will not arise in their Samadhi. Samadhi here means the mind. The knowledge of the self will not arise in such minds. In the minds of these persons, there cannot arise the mental disposition that looks on all Vedic rituals as means for liberation based on the determined conviction about the real form of the self. Hence, in an aspirant for liberation, there should be no attachment to rituals out of the conviction that they are meant for the acisition of objects of desire only.\nIt may be estioned why the Vedas, which have more of love for Jivas than thousands of parents, and which are endeavouring to save the Jivas, should prescribe in this way rites whose fruits are infinitesimal and which produce only new births. It can also be asked if it is proper to abandon what is given in the Vedas. Sri Krsna replies to these estions.","chakravarthi":"Text 42: This verse speaks of the persons with wavering intelligence, involved in sakama karma, who are very dull witted. They speak excellently (pra vadanti)16 pleasant words of the Vedas which are like a poisonous flowering plant. Since their consciousness has been deluded by those words, they are not endowed with fixed intelligence, (taya apahrta cetasam vyavasayatmika buddhih samadhau na vidhiyate). The sentence continues in verse 44. Because of the impossibility for them to accept, it is not taught to them. They speak in this way because they are fools (avipascitah), because they interpret the words of the Vedas (veda vada ratah) such as the following:\naksayyam ha vai caturmasya-yajinah sukrtam bhavati\nOne who has worshiped by means of the vows of caturmasya attains pious credits which never become depleted. Apastambha Srauta Sutra, Krishna Yajur Veda 8.1.1\napama somam amrta abhuma\nWe drank soma and became immortal. Rg Veda 8.48.3\nThey say that there is no God other than this (na anyat asti).\nText 43: What type of words do they speak? They speak words about various rites giving many results in terms of power and enjoyment, words which give good results of action in terms of birth.","rudra":"\nOne may wonder why is it that living entities filled with desire fail to\nrelinquish even desires which are very difficult to fulfil and adhere in\nfixed determination to surrendering their actions to the Supreme Lord? This\nis now being answered that they are dull witted of limited understanding\nwho consider heaven as the highest attainment. Why do they talk such\nnonsense? Because they are of dull wits and limited understanding. The\nreason for their dull wits is that they are enamoured by the panegyric\neuphemisms of the scriptures. Words like everlasting happiness, eternal\nlife, resurrection and immortality are very appealing to those of limited\nunderstanding. With these thoughts motivating them they perform every\nactions for the attainment of these goals believing they can be attained\nindependent of the mercy of the Supreme Lord","brahma":"There is no commentary for this verse.","shri":"There is no commentary for this verse.","kumar":"Why is it that the scholars who have studied the Vedas so fastidiously fail\nto possess the resolute intelligence? It is because they could not\ncomprehend the essence of the Vedic scriptures and subsequently they missed\nunderstanding the true purport of the Vedas. This Lord Krishna emphasises\nwith the word avipascitah meaning the ignorant who are not knowledgeable\nare attracted to flowery descriptions in the Vedas even as a beautiful\nflowery creeper may be attractive although it is poisonous. But these\nliving entities are ignorant and not actual scholars of Vedanta because\nthey are only devoted to those parts of the Vedas which help them secure\nmaterial opulence in this life and the next. Such statements like by\nperforming some ritual one can obtain imperishable merit or by drinking\nSoma nectar one can become immortal, etc. Their conception of devotion is\nbeing devoted to pursuing heavenly delights and they even foolishly argue\nthat there is nothing more beyond the rewards of heavenly pleasures to\nattain. Why is this so for them? It is because their minds are obsessed by\ndesires due to addiction to material pleasures experienced by contact with\nthe senses of taste, touch, seeing, hearing and smelling. So they look upon\nheaven although heaven is still in the material existence as being the\nsupreme goal. This is because in heaven there is neither old age or\nsickness, everything is beautiful and a wonder to behold and the facility\nto enjoy fully is increased a thousand fold. So all their activities in\nthis life are enacted solely for the sake of accuring benefits in order to\nreside in the heavenly spheres where they can enjoy and enjoy for a\nseemingly unlimited time span. But when their merit has expired after\nenjoying the delights of heaven in various wonderful ways to their hearts\ncontent they will again take birth on earth in a rich and learned family\nwho also are following the flowery phrases of the Vedas and they will again\nfollow this path and at lifes end transmigrate to the heavenly planets once\nagain to enact the process. By being born into situations of opulence and\nprosperity allows one ample meansandfacilitytoperformvery\nextravagantly the various prescribed rituals suchasastrologically\nperforming activities on the auspicious days each month such as purnima to\nobtain the maximum result. Thus again and again from body to body they are\ncontinuously revolving like a waterwheel. In special situations Indra, the\nruler of the demi-gods sometimes appoints one of them as a gandharva\ncelestial musician or as an aspara celestial damsel among the demigods for\nthe duration of time their merit warrants."}
