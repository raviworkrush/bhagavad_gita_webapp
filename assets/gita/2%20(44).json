पूर्वश्लोकोंमें जिस पुष्पित वाणीका वर्णन किया गया है  उस वाणीसे जिनका चित्त अपहृत हो गया है अर्थात् स्वर्गमें बड़ा भारी सुख है दिव्य नन्दनवन है अप्सराएँ हैं अमृत है ऐसी वाणीसे जिनका चित्त उन भोगोंकी तरफ खिंच गया है। भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानाम्   शब्द स्पर्श रूप रस और गन्ध ये पाँच विषय शरीरका आराम मान और नामकी बड़ाई इनके द्वारा सुख लेनेका नाम भोग है। भोगोंके लिये पदार्थ रूपयेपैसे मकान आदिका जो संग्रह किया जाता है उसका नाम ऐश्वर्य है। इन भोग और ऐश्वर्यमें जिनकी आसक्ति है प्रियता है खिंचाव है अर्थात् इनमें जिनकी महत्त्वबुद्धि है उनको  भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानाम्  कहा गया है।जो भोग और ऐश्वर्यमें ही लगे रहते हैं वे आसुरी सम्पत्तिवाले होते हैं। कारण कि असु नाम प्राणोंका है और उन प्राणोंको जो बनाये रखना चाहते हैं उन प्राणपोषणपरायण लोगोंका नाम असुर है। वे शरीरकी प्रधानताको लेकर यहाँके अथवा स्वर्गके भोग भोगना चाहते हैं  (टिप्पणी प0 80) ।  व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते   जो मनुष्यजन्मका असली ध्येय है जिसके लिये मनुष्यशरीर मिला है उस परमात्माको ही प्राप्त करना है ऐसी व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धि उन लोगोंमें नहीं होती। तात्पर्य यह है कि जो भोग भोगे जा चुके हैं जो भोग भोगे जा सकते हैं जिन भोगोंको सुन रखा है और जो भोग सुने जा सकते हैं उनके संस्कारोंके कारण बुद्धिमें जो मलिनता रहती है उस मलिनताके कारण संसारसे सर्वथा विरक्त होकर एक परमात्माकी तरफ चलना है ऐसा दृढ़ निश्चय नहीं होता। ऐसे ही संसारकी अनेक विद्याओं कलाओं आदिका जो संग्रह है उससे मैं विद्वान हूँमैं जानकार हूँऐसा जो अभिमानजन्य सुखका भोग होता है उसमें आसक्त मनुष्योंका भी परमात्मप्राप्तिका एक निश्चय नहीं होता। विशेष बात परमदयालु प्रभुने कृपा करके इस मनुष्यशरीरमें एक ऐसी विलक्षण विवेकशक्ति दी है जिससे वह सुखदुःखसे ऊँचा उठ जाय अपना उद्धार कर ले सबकी सेवा करके भगवान्तकको अपने वशमें कर ले इसीमें मनुष्यशरीरकी सार्थकता है। परन्तु प्रभुप्रदत्त इस विवेकशक्तिका अनादर करके नाशवान् भोग और संग्रहमें आसक्त हो जाना पशुबुद्धि है। कारण कि पशुपक्षी भी भोगोंमें लगे रहते हैं ऐसे ही अगर मनुष्य भी भोगोंमें लगा रहे तो पशुपक्षियोंमें और मनुष्यमें अन्तर ही क्या रहापशुपक्षी तो भोगयोनि है अतः उनके सामने कर्तव्यका प्रश्न ही नहीं है। परन्तु मनुष्यजन्म तो केवल अपने कर्तव्यका पालन करके अपना उद्धार करनेके लिये ही मिला है भोग भोगनेके लिये नहीं। इसलिये मनुष्यके सामने जो कुछ अनुकूलप्रतिकूल परिस्थिति आती है वह सब साधनसामग्री है भोगसामग्री नहीं। जो उसको भोगसामग्री मान लेते हैं उनकी परमात्मामें व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धि नहीं होती।वास्तवमें सांसारिक पदार्थ परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेमें बाधा नहीं देते प्रत्युत वर्तमानमें जो भोगोंका महत्व अन्तःकरणमें बैठा हुआ है वही बाधा देता है। भोग उतना नहीं अटकाते जितना भोगोंका महत्व अटकाता है। अटकानेमें अपनी रुचि नीयतकी प्रधानता है। भोग और संग्रहकी रुचिको रखते हुए कोई परमात्माको प्राप्त करना चाहे तो परमात्माकी प्राप्ति तो दूर रही उनकी प्राप्तिका एक निश्चय भी नहीं हो सकता। कारण कि जहाँ परमात्माकी तरफ चलनेकी रुचि है वहीं भोगोंकी रुचि भी है। जबतक भोग और संग्रहमें मानबड़ाईआराममें रुचि है तबतक कोई भी एक निश्चय करके परमात्मामें नहीं लग सकता क्योंकि उसका अन्तःकरण भोगोंकी रुचिद्वारा हर लिया गया उसकी जो शक्ति थी वह भोग और संग्रहमें लग गयी। सम्बन्ध   किसी बातको पुष्ट करना हो तो पहले उसके दोनों पक्ष सामने रखकर फिर उसको पुष्ट किया जाता है। यहाँ भगवान् निष्कामभावको पुष्ट करना चाहते हैं अतः पीछेके तीन श्लोकोंमें सकामभाववालोंका वर्णन करके अब आगेके श्लोकमें निष्काम होनेकी प्रेरणा करते हैं।","hcsca":"।।2.44।। महर्षि व्यास ऐसे पहले साहसी क्रान्तिकारी थे जिन्होंने अपने काल में अत्यन्त शोचनीय पतन की स्थिति से हिन्दू संस्कृति का पुनरुत्थान किया। क्रान्ति का वह ग्रन्थ गीता है जिसकी रचना उन्होंने की। अपने काल की स्थितियों की उनके द्वारा की गयी तीव्र आलोचना भगवान् के इन शब्दों से स्पष्ट होती है जहां श्रीकृष्ण वेदों के कर्मकाण्ड को पुष्पिता वाणी कहते हैं। कर्मकाण्ड की तीव्र आलोचना करने में व्यास जी के साहस को समझने के लिये हमें उस काल के पुरोगामी पारम्परिक वातावरण की कल्पना करनी होगी हमें मानसिक रूप से उस काल में रहना होगा।वेदों का कर्मकाण्ड उन लोगों के लिए है जो विषयोपभोग और ऐश्वर्य में अत्यन्त आसक्त हैं कर्मफल पाने की इच्छा और चिन्ता के कारण जिनकी सदसद् विवेक की क्षमता खो गयी है। सर्वोच्च साध्य को भूलकर साधनभूत कर्मों में ही वे लिप्त रहते हैं।वेदोक्त कर्मों को अत्यन्त परिश्रमपूर्वक करना पड़ता है तब मृत्यु के पश्चात् स्वर्ग के रूप में उनका फल प्राप्त होता है जहाँ अलौकिक विषयों का उपभोग किया जा सकता है। इन सब प्रयत्नों में कामनाओं और चिन्ताओं आदि के कारण व्यक्तित्व के विकास के लिये अवसर नहीं मिलता इसलिये व्यास जी का विचार है कि अध्यात्म की दृष्टि से ये सकाम कर्म निरर्थक हैं। कर्मकाण्ड में आसक्त पुरुष जीवन के परम साध्य को भूलकर साधन में ही फंसा रह जाता है।अनन्तस्वरूप परम सत्य के प्रतिपादक के रूप में श्रीकृष्ण उन लोगों की हँसी उड़ाते हैं जो साधन को ही साध्य मानने की त्रुटि करते हैं। कर्मकाण्ड में ही उपदिष्ट केवल कर्तव्य कर्म के पालन से चित्त शुद्धि एवं एकाग्रता प्राप्त होती है और इस प्रकार ध्यान का अभ्यास करने की योग्यता पाकर उपनिषदों में निरूपित निदिध्यासन के द्वारा आत्मा का अपरोक्ष अनुभव प्राप्त होता है जो जीवन का वास्तविक साध्य है। कर्म में ही रत पुरुषों को जीवन में कभी शान्ति नहीं मिलती।अविवेकी कामी पुरुषों को क्या फल मिलता है भगवान् कहते हैं","etsga":"2.44 One-pointed conviction does not become established in the minds of those who delight in enjoyment and affluence, and whose intellects are carried away by that (speech).","etssa":"2.44 For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, ï1thatï1 determinate reason is not formed which is steadily bent on meditation and Samadhi (superconscious state).","etdss":"2.44. Those, who are very much attached to the ownership of enjoyable objects and whose minds have been carried away by that (flowery speech)-their knowledge, in the form of determination is not prescribed for concentration.","ecssa":"2.44 भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानाम् of the people deeply attached to pleasure and lordship? तया by that? अपहृतचेतसाम् whose minds are drawn away? व्यवसायात्मिका determinate? बुद्धिः reason? समाधौ in Samadhi? न not? विधीयते is fixed.Commentary Those who cling to pleasure and power cannot have steadiness of mind. They cannot concentrate or meditate. They are ever busy in planning projects for the acisition of wealth and power. Their minds are ever restless. They have no poised understanding.","scetsga":"2.44 And vyavasayatmika, one-pointed; buddhih, conviction, with regard to Knowledge or Yoga; na vidhiyate, does not become established, i.e. does not arise; samadhau, in the minds the word samadhi being derived in the sese of that into which everthing is gathered together for the enjoyment of a person ; bhoga-aisvarya-prasaktanam, of those who delight in enjoyment and wealth, of those who have the hankering that only enjoyment as also wealth is to be sought for, of those who identify themselves with these; and apahrta-cetasam, of those whose intellects are carried away, whose discriminating judgement becomes covered; taya, by that speech which is full of various special rites.","scetdss":"2.42-44 Yam imam etc., upto na vidhiyate. Those, who crave for objects of desire, speak, on their own accord, of this flowery Vedic speech which is pervaded by the fruits i.e., the heaven in the future; and who, hence, desire the action itself as the fruit of their birth - these are men without insight. further, having their mind carried away by the same Vedic sentence imagined by themselves, these persons, eventhough they are endowed with the determinate knowledge, are not fit for concentration, because they do not decide this (concentration) as a fruit [of their action]. This is the purport of the traid of these verses.","scetssa":"2.42 - 2.44 The ignorant, whose knowledge is little, and who have as their sole aim the attainment of enjoyment and power, speak the flowery language i.e., having its flowers (show) only as fruits, which look apparently beautiful at first sight. They rejoice in the letter of the Vedas i.e., they are attached to heaven and such other results (promised in the Karma-kanda of the Vedas). They say that there is nothing else, owing to their intense attachment to these results. They say that there is no fruit superior to heaven etc. They are full of worldly desires and their minds are highly attached to secular desires. They hanker for heaven, i.e. think of the enjoyment of the felicities of heaven, after which one can again have rirth which offers again the opportunity to perform varied rites devoid of true knowledge and leads towards the attainment of enjoyments and power once again.\nWith regard to those who cling to pleasure and power and whose understanding is contaminated by that flowery speech relating to pleasure and lordly powers, the aforesaid mental disposition characterised by resolution, will not arise in their Samadhi. Samadhi here means the mind. The knowledge of the self will not arise in such minds. In the minds of these persons, there cannot arise the mental disposition that looks on all Vedic rituals as means for liberation based on the determined conviction about the real form of the self. Hence, in an aspirant for liberation, there should be no attachment to rituals out of the conviction that they are meant for the acisition of objects of desire only.\nIt may be estioned why the Vedas, which have more of love for Jivas than thousands of parents, and which are endeavouring to save the Jivas, should prescribe in this way rites whose fruits are infinitesimal and which produce only new births. It can also be asked if it is proper to abandon what is given in the Vedas. Sri Krsna replies to these estions.","chakravarthi":"Those whose minds are attracted by the flowery words, who are attached to power and enjoyment, do not have the determined intelligence fixed firmly on one point (samadhau), on only the Supreme Lord. The form of the verb na vidhiyate is reflexive passive (karma kartari), meaning in this case “is not attained.” This commentary is Sridhara Swami’s version.","rudra":"\nThe spiritual understanding which leads to a fixed determination is not\nachieved by those whose minds are carried away by flowery euphemisms which\nare temporarily so appealing to the mind of those of limited understanding.\nThose euphemisms which refer to heavenly pleasures and heavenly delights\nare constituted by them as the highest goal of human existence.. Regarding\nconceptions of heaven as the highest goal they foolishly endeavour to\nattain it by the purview of their limited understanding believing that once\nthere they can fully enjoy themselves to their hearts content eternally.\nTherefore those who are enslaved to wealth, enjoyment and power for their\nown sake never are able to receive the spiritual intelligence which leads\nto fixed determination in regard to surrendering all ones actions for the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord.","brahma":"\nThe opinions of those who are not resolute are contrary to the Vedic\nscriptures; but the summations of those who are resolute possessing\nspiritual intelligence are never contrary to the Vedic scriptures. Arjuna\nmay query why the Supreme Lord speaks about things providing pleasures of\nheaven, this is clarified by the Supreme Lord in this verse. In verse 42\nbeginning yam to the word taya in verse forty-four it can be ascertained\nthat if salvation is the fruit then any heavenly pleasures are merely the\nflowers.\nThose who revel only in the words of the Vedas are known as Vedavad ratah.\nThey speak only of revelling in the pleasures derived from actions. Those\nwho speak about the Vedas in expectation of fruits are said to revel\ntherein and thus they are motivated by desire. The essence and the\nobjective of the Vedic scriptures is knowledge of the Ultimate, which is\nthe Supreme Lord, who is very pleased by those who are devoted to Him. The\ninstructions and injunctions within the Vedic scriptures should be known to\nbe applicable solely to the Supreme Lord and no other. It is the knowledge\nof the Supreme Lord that is to be sought and understood. This is what is to\nbe achieved by all living entities to make their life in the material\nexistence successful.\nIn reference to those pursuing the goals of opulence and pleasure and in\nreference to the means of acquiring those fruits thereof, these vedavad\nratahs declare that this is knowledge of Vedanta.For these persons\nspiritual intelligence and comprehensive discrimination does not manifest\nitself in the form of an equinanimous intellect. Only those in whom\nspiritual intelligence has awakened have comprehensive knowledge of the\nSupreme Lord and the total satisfaction of mind and senses that accompanies\nit. Verily this is the means for salvation. It is also specifically\nmentioned in the Srimad Bhagavatam known also as the Bhagavat Purana.\nNot for these vedavad ratahs is the realisation of the Ultimate Truth\nspoken of in the Vedas in all their entirety. For whom realisation does not\ndawn that the empirical world is similar to the perception of the world\nseen in the dream state? In whom then does exist thisirresolute\nintelligence? In those who listen to the words of those without spiritual\nintelligence? When ones consciousness is abducted by speculative schemes\nstemming from fruitive desires it is not possible for satisfaction of the\nmind to manifest.\nFactually as things are, similar is the spiritual intelligence. Knowledge\nwhich is distorted, similarly is that satisfaction derived from such\nknowledge distorted. Spiritual conceptions do not arise in minds which are\ninfluenced by distorted knowledge. In these minds onlyamaterial\nconception of heaven and heavenly pleasures can be somewhat envisioned; but\nnot the understanding that the Supreme Lord is actually the controller of\nall the worlds and the bequeather of all blessings and that only by serving\nHim, by His grace and only by His grace can all living entities attain\nsalvation. Those living entities who adhere to the Vedic scriptures for\nthe purpose of enjoying material pleasures and acquiring wealth and\nopulence, perform repeated acts of ritualistic sacrifice which while\nbestowing their material rewards in future lifetimes become the cause of an\nendless repetition of birth and death in the material existence.\nWhen the minds of those living entities not prescribed to the Vedic culture\nbecome deluded by the words of evil minded living entities who speak words\ncontrary to the Vedic scriptures it becomes impossible for them to receive\nany spiritual knowledge which would be beneficial for their spiritual\ndevelopment.\nIn the Atharvana scripture it is stated:\nThe living entities who being are influenced by such words, doctrines and\nphilosophies which are contrary to the Vedic scriptures, consider that the\npursuance and fulfilment of desired objects is the purpose of life and\nnothing else is superior to this, are most certainly deluded. Enjoying\nwhatever pleasures they have managed to manipulate for themselves they are\nrepeatedly born again and again cast down into the material existence or\ndepending upon the method of how they acquired their material opulence even\nhurled down to be born in animal species or in the hellish worlds.\nOne should therefore not become a victim and become prey to those being\nheretic or devious, who think and act contrary to the spiritual knowledge\nof the Vedic scriptures which are revealed in the best interest and highest\ngood of every living entities in all of material existence.\nThose living entities who are unable to understand the reality of the\nSupreme Lord Krishnas unimpeachable position and thus unaware cannot have\nthe realisation of Him as the Supreme Ultimate controller of all the worlds\nboth spiritual and material. Even if they be sincere, receptive, qualified\nand noble beings; without receiving bonafide instruction from the Vedic\nscriptures from one in the authorised process of disciplic succession one\nis devoid of spiritual intelligence returning endlessly again and again\ninto a physical form in the material existence.But for those living\nentities who are able to understand the reality of the Supreme Lord\nKrishnas unparalleled position and realise that He is the ultimate\ncontroller of all the worlds both spiritual and material they are never put\ninto jeopardy and even if they accrued some demerits and had to accept some\nkarma which are reactions to previous actions, this karma would definitely\nall be nullified within the lifetime as these living entities of spiritual\nintelligence receive the special blessings of the Lord.\nThose living entities who perform comprehensive sacrificial activities\nprescribed by one in the authorised line of disciplic succession for the\nsatisfaction of the Supreme Lord Krishna; but who are in reality opposed to\nHis supremacy; even if they have not acquired any demerits, even if they\nhave satisfied their preceptor with gifts, even if they have manipulated\nthemselves to attain some fleeting pleasures in the heavenly realms; still\nwhen whatever merit they have acquired is exhausted they willsink back\ndown into worlds of darkness. Others who remain inimical to the Supreme\nLord Krishna and who are inimical to the spiritual knowledge revealed in\nthe Vedic scriptures go directly to the worlds of darkness at the death of\ntheir physical body without enjoying any of the heavenly realms.","shri":"Ramanuja.\nBhagavad-Gita: chapter 2, verse 45\nHere we see the word traigunya indicating the three qualities of material\nnature being goodness, passion and ignorance.
