The knower of the All should not disturb those of dull intellect, who do not know the All.","etssa":"3.29 Those deluded by the alities of Nature are attached to the functions of the alities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish one who is of imperfect knowledge.","etdss":"3.29. Men, completely deluded by the Strands of the Prakrti, are attached to the actions of the Strands. Man, who know fully, should not confuse them, the dullard, who do not know fully.","ecssa":"3.29 प्रकृतेः of nature? गुणसंमूढाः persons deluded by the Gunas? सज्जन्ते are attached? गुणकर्मसु in the functions of the alities? तान् those? अकृत्स्नविदः of imperfect knowledge? मन्दान् the foolish (thedullwitted)? कृत्स्नवित् man of perfect knowledge? न not? विचालयेत् should unsettle.Commentary The ignorant people do action with the expectation of fruits. The wise people who have the knowledge of the Self should not distract the faith or conviction or belief of such ignorant persons. If they unsettle their minds they will give up actions and become victims of inertia. They will lead an idle life. They should be encouraged by the wise to do actions of the Sakama type (actions for the sake of their fruits) in the beginning. The wise ones should turn the minds of the ignorant by giving them gradual instructions on Karma Yoga (Yoga of selfless? desireless action) and its benefits? viz.? purification of the heart that leads to the attainment of Selfrealisation.","scetsga":"3.29 Those again, guna-sammudhah, who are wholly deluded by the gunas; prakrteh, of Nature; sajjante, become attached; guna karmasu, to the activities of the gunas, thining, We do actions for results. Krtsna-vit, the knower of the All, one who is himself a knower of the Self; na vicalayet, should not disturb; tan, those who are attached to actions; (who are) mandan, of dull intellect; akrtsnavidah, who do not know the All, who are all attention on the results of actions. Unsetting of beliefs is itself the disturbance. That he should not do. This is the idea.\nAgain, in what manner should duties be under-taken by a seeker after Liberation who is not enlightened, who is alified for actions (rites and duties)? As to this, the answer is being stated:","scetdss":"3.29 Prakrteh etc. The deluded persons, under the influence of the Strands, Sattva etc., are attached to the actions performed by the Sattva etc., which are the Strands belonging to the Prakrti.\n In the same context (III, 26) it has been said : Therefore being a master of Yoga, let [the wise] fulfil actions. How to do that ? [The Lord] clarifies :","scetssa":"3.29 Those who do not know the whole truth are those persons who are trying for the vision of the self but are deluded about the nature of the self, not knowing, on account of their involvement in Prakrti, that actions proceed from the Gunas of Prakrti. They are therefore attached to the actions of the Gunas - i.e., only to actions forming part of Karma Yoga. They are alified only for Karma Yoga. One who knows the complete truth should not, by himself remaining a practitioner of Jnana Yoga, unsettle those persons who are ignorant and who do not know the complete truth. Those, the ignorant, who tend to follow the behaviour of a great man, when they see him transcend Karma Yoga, will have their minds shaken from Karma Yoga. Thus, the great man, should himself remain established in Karma Yoga, while having the full knowledge of the true nature of the self and contemplating on the self as not being the agent. Thus he should demonstrate that Karma Yoga by itself is an autonomous means for the vision of the self. He should create in those who do not know the complete truth the love of Karma Yoga.\nThe superiority of this Karma Yoga over Jnana Yoga even for those who are alified for Jnana Yoga has already been stated. Therefore one who is a respected person of note should follow this Karma Yoga alone for the good of the world. The method of performing actions after attributing agency to the Gunas by discerning the nature of the self as different from Prakrti, has been taught. The agency of the self is not produced by the inherent nature of the self, but by its contact with the Gunas. Hence by discriminating between what is obtained by contact and not obtained when there is no contact, it has to be understood that this agency is due to the Gunas or Prakrti.\nNow it is said that the agency of works, first attributed to Gunas, ultimately go to the Supreme Person who is the Self of all. It is done by discerning that the nature of the individual self is one of subservience to the Supreme Person, as they constitute His body:","chakravarthi":"If the jivas are separate from the senses and the sense objects without relationship to them, then why is it seen that people are attached to the sense objects? This verse answers.\nBy  absorption  in  the  senses  made  of matter jivas  become bewildered. Just like a man possessed by a ghost thinks himself a ghost, the jivas absorbed in the senses made of matter think themselves to be the senses. Then they become attached to the sense objects (guna karmasu). The   man   who   knows all (krtsnavit) does not disturb those who are ignorant. He does not attempt to make them realize that they, as jivas, are different from the senses, that they are not the senses. Instead he engages them in action without desire, which will remove the absorption in the senses. One does not cure a man possessed of a ghost even by instructing him even a hundred times, “You are a man, not a ghost!” Instead one cures him by use of mantras, jewels and medicines which will remove that affliction.","rudra":"\nWhen Lord Krishna states that one should not disturb the minds, He is\nreferring to the ignorant, all those who are still deluded by prakriti or\nthe material nature and the three gunas or the modes of sattva or goodness,\nrajas or passion and tamas or nescience. One who is situated in the wisdom\nof Vedic knowledge should not unbalance the equilibrium of the ignorant who\nalthough attached to the results of actions are at least doing their daily\nduties.","brahma":"\nThe attributes of nature are those that are abducted by the senses thus\ndelusion arises and the conception of false ego enjoying the sense objects\nimpels a reaction. Lord Krishna uses the word guna-karmasu means the\nreactions from actions influenced by the modes of goodness, passion and\nnescience. Auditory and visual sense objects capture the attention of the\nsenses being the ear and eye respectively and bring like or dislike to the\nmind. It should be understood that the impulses that come from the sense\nobjects are secondary attributes and they have reactions and bind one to\nsamsara the cycle of birth and death.","shri":"\nThe misinformed make attempts for atma-tattva or soul realisation but due\nto their ignorance of the true nature of the atma or soul and because of\ntheir acute identification with the physical body and the senses they are\nobstructed in their attempts by the influences of the three gunas being the\nmode of goodness, passion and nescience. Such a person is quickly brought\nunder the control of the gunas by their association with sense objects and\ncannot divert these natural tendencies towards atma-tattva. Thus they are\nnot qualified for jnana yoga or the cultivation of knowledge but are only\ncompetent for karma yoga or performing prescribed Vedic activities.\nThe person situated in Vedic wisdom in jnana yoga after observing the\nmeager capacities of the ignorant masses with their sluggish understanding\nshould not attempt to convert them to jnana yoga from their easy to perform\npath of karma yoga. This is because it would be dangerous for the ignorant\nto give up the path of karma yoga to follow the path of jnana yoga when\nthey are in no way qualified to do so. Leaving the path of karma yoga and\nunable to follow the path of jnana yoga they would having nothing and be at\na loss in their lives. The conclusion is that one situated in Vedic wisdom\nand is a prominent leading figure in society should also perform prescribed\nVedic activities in karma yoga even though such a person is a knower of\natma-tattva. By acting in this way and performing Vedic activities without\nattachment lesser men will follow his example and perform in a like manner.\nIt has been shown earlier in this chapter that even for jnana yogis the\npath of karma yoga is preferable, hence persons of Vedic wisdom who are\nleaders in society should also tread the path of karma yoga as beacons of\nlight for the masses in the world. The method of performing karma yoga by\nunderstanding that the atma is distinct from the physical body and thus\nascribing the activities of the senses to be from the influences of the\ngunas has been thoroughly described.\nOne should contemplate and reflect on the atma and its essential nature\nwhich is purely spiritual. The atma performs no material activity but has\nassociation with actions through the gunas due to the conjunction with\nprakriti. Thus in association with prakriti there is doer ship with the\natma and without association there is none. The next verse will explain the\nrelationship between the senses and the gunas in regards to the Supreme\nLord who is omniscient and omnipresent. Paramatma who is the Supreme Soul\nof all living entities evidenced by the fact that every individual soul\nconstitutes His eternal, transcendental, spiritual body and are His eternal\nparts and parcels.","kumar":"The misinformed make attempts for atma-tattva or soul realisation but due\nto their ignorance of the true nature of the atma or soul and because of\ntheir acute identification with the physical body and the senses they are\nobstructed in their attempts by the influences of the three gunas being the\nmode of goodness, passion and nescience.
