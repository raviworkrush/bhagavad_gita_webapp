प्रकार जितने भी साधन हैं सब साध्यरूप हो जायँ तभी वे यज्ञ होते हैं।जितने भी यज्ञ हैं उनमें परमात्मतत्त्वका अनुभव करना भावना नहीं है प्रत्युत वास्तविकता है। भावना तोपदार्थोंकी है।इस चौबीसवें श्लोकसे तीसवें श्लोकतक जिन यज्ञोंका वर्णन किया गया है वे सब कर्मयोग के अन्तर्गत हैं। कारण कि भगवान्ने इस प्रकरणके उपक्रममें भी तत्ते कर्म प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् (4। 16) ऐसा कहा है और उपसंहारमें भी कर्मजान्विद्धि तान्सर्वानेवं ज्ञात्वा विमोक्ष्यसे (4। 32) ऐसा कहा है तथा बीचमें भी कहा है यज्ञायाचरतः कर्म समग्रं प्रविलीयते (4। 23)। मुख्य बात यह है कि यज्ञकर्ताके सभी कर्म अकर्म हो जायँ। यज्ञ केवल यज्ञपरम्पराकी रक्षाके लिये किये जायँ तो सबकेसब कर्म अकर्म हो जाते हैं। अतः इन सब यज्ञोंमें कर्ममें अकर्म का ही वर्णन है।ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविः जिस पात्रसे अग्निमें आहुति दी जाती है उस स्रुक् स्रुवा आदिको यहाँ अर्पणम् पदसे कहा गया है अर्प्यते अनेन इति अर्पणम्। उस अर्पणको ब्रह्म ही माने।तिल जौ घी आदि जिन पदार्थोंका हवन किया जाता है उन हव्य पदार्थोंको भी ब्रह्म ही माने।ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् आहुति देनेवाला भी ब्रह्म ही है (गीता 13। 2) जिसमें आहुति दी जा रही है वह अग्नि भी ब्रह्म ही है और आहुति देनारूप क्रिया भी ब्रह्म ही है ऐसा माने।ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना जैसे हवन करनेवाला पुरुष स्रुवा हवि अग्नि आदि सबको ब्रह्मका ही स्वरूप मानता है ऐसे ही जो प्रत्येक कर्ममें कर्ता करण कर्म और पदार्थ सबको ब्रह्मरूप ही अनुभव करता है उस पुरुषकी ब्रह्ममें ही कर्मसमाधि होती है अर्थात् उसकी सम्पूर्ण कर्मोंमें ब्रह्मबुद्धि होती है। उसके लिये सम्पूर्ण कर्म ब्रह्मरूप ही बन जाते हैं। ब्रह्मके सिवाय कर्मोंका अपना कोई अलग स्वरूप रहता ही नहीं।ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यम् ब्रह्ममें ही कर्मसमाधि होनेसे जिसके सम्पूर्ण कर्म ब्रह्मरूप ही बन गये हैं उसे फलके रूपमें निःसन्देह ब्रह्मकी ही प्राप्ति होती है। कारण कि उसकी दृष्टिमें ब्रह्मके सिवाय और किसीकी स्वतन्त्र सत्ता रहती ही नहीं।इस (चौबीसवें) श्लोकको शिष्टजन भोजनके समय बोलते हैं जिससे भोजनरूप कर्म भी यज्ञ बन जाय। भोजनरूप कर्ममें ब्रह्मबुद्धि इस प्रकार की जाती है (1) जिससे अर्पण किया जाता है वह हाथ भी ब्रह्मरूप है सर्वतः पाणिपादं तत् (गीता 13। 13)।(2) भोजनके पदार्थ भी ब्रह्मरूप हैं अहमेवाज्यम् (गीता 9। 16)।(3) भोजन करनेवाला भी ब्रह्मरूप है ममैवांशो जीवलोके (गीता 15। 7)।(4) जठराग्नि भी ब्रह्मरूप है अहं वैश्वानरः (गीता 15। 14)।(5) भोजन करनारूप क्रिया अर्थात् जठराग्निमें अन्नकी आहुति देनारूप क्रिया भी ब्रह्म है अहं हुतम् (गीता 9। 16)।(6) इस प्रकार भोजन करनेवाले मनुष्योंके द्वारा प्राप्त करनेयोग्य फल भी ब्रह्म ही है यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम् (गीता 4। 31)।मार्मिक बातप्रकृतिके कार्य संसारका स्वरूप है क्रिया और पदार्थ। वास्तविक दृष्टिसे देखा जाय तो प्रकृति या संसार क्रियारूप ही है (टिप्पणी प0 255)। कारण कि पदार्थ एक क्षण भी स्थिर नहीं रहता उसमें निरन्तर परिवर्तन होता रहता है। अतः वास्तवमें पदार्थ परिवर्तनरूप क्रियाका पुञ्ज ही है। केवल राग के कारण पदार्थकी मुख्यता दीखती है। सम्पूर्ण क्रियाएँ अभावमें जा रही हैं। अतः संसार अभावरूप ही है। भावरूपसे केवल एक अक्रियतत्त्व ब्रह्म ही है जिसकी सत्तासे अभावरूप संसार भी सत्तावान् प्रतीत हो रहा है। संसारकी अभावरूपताको इस प्रकारसे समझ सकते हैं संसारकी तीन अवस्थाएँ दीखती हैं उत्पत्ति स्थिति और प्रलय जैसे वस्तु उत्पन्न होती है फिर रहती है और अन्तमें नष्ट हो जाती है अथवा मनुष्य जन्म लेता है फिर रहता है और अन्तमें मर जाता है। इससे आगे विचार करें तो केवल उत्पत्ति और प्रलयका ही क्रम है स्थिति वस्तुतः है ही नहीं जैसे यदि मनुष्यकी पूरी आयु पचास वर्षकी है तो बीस वर्ष बीतनेपर उसकी आयु तीस वर्ष ही रह जाती है। इससे आगे विचार करें तो केवल प्रलयहीप्रलय (नाशहीनाश) है उत्पत्ति है ही नहीं जैसे आयुके जितने वर्ष बीत गये उतने वर्ष मनुष्य मर ही गया। इस प्रकार मनुष्य प्रतिक्षण ही मर रहा है उसका जीवन प्रतिक्षण ही मृत्युमें जा रहा है। दृश्यमात्र प्रतिक्षण अदृश्यमें जा रहा है। प्रलय अभावका ही नाम है इसलिये अभाव ही शेष रहा। अभावकी सत्ता भावरूप ब्रह्मपर ही टिकी हुई है। अतः भावरूपसे एक ब्रह्म ही शेष रहा सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म (छान्दोग्य0 3। 14। 1) वासुदेवः सर्वम् (गीता 7। 19)।","hcsca":"।।4.24।। यह एक प्रसिद्ध श्लोक है जिसको भारत में भोजन प्रारम्भ करने के पूर्व पढ़ा जाता है किन्तु अधिकांश लोग न तो इसका अर्थ जानते हैं और न जानने का प्रयत्न ही करते हैं। तथापि इसका अर्थ गंभीर है और इसमें सम्पूर्ण वेदान्त के सार को बता दिया गया है।वह अनन्त पारमार्थिक सत्य जो इस दृश्यमान नित्य परिवर्तनशील जगत् का अधिष्ठान है वेदान्त में ब्रह्म शब्द के द्वारा निर्देशित किया जाता है। यही ब्रह्म एक शरीर से परिच्छिन्नसा हुआ आत्मा कहलाता है। एक ही तत्त्व इन दो शब्दों से लक्षित किया है और वेदान्त केसरी की यह गर्जना है कि आत्मा ही ब्रह्म है।इस श्लोक में वैदिक यज्ञ का रूपक है। प्रत्येक यज्ञ में चार प्रमुख आवश्यक वस्तुएं होती हैं (1) यज्ञ का देवता जिसे आहुति दी जाती है (2) अग्नि (3) हवन के योग्य द्रव्य पदार्थ हवि (शाकल्य) और (4) यज्ञकर्ता व्यक्ति।यज्ञ भावना से कर्म करते हुए ज्ञानी पुरुष की मन की स्थिति एवं अनुभूति का वर्णन इस श्लोक में किया गया है। उसके अनुभव की दृष्टि से एक पारमार्थिक सत्य ही विद्यमान है न कि अविद्या से उत्पन्न नामरूपमय यह जगत्। अत वह जानता है कि सभी यज्ञों की उत्पत्ति ब्रह्म से ही होती है जिनमें देवता अग्नि हवि और यज्ञकर्ता सभी ब्रह्म हैं। जब एक तरंग दूसरी तरंग पर से उछलती हुई अन्य साथी तरंग से मिल जाती है तब इस दृश्य को देखते हुए हम जानते हैं कि ये सब तरंगे समुद्र के अतिरिक्त और कुछ नहीं है। समुद्र में ही समुद्र का खेल चल रहा है।यदि कोई व्यक्ति जगत् के असंख्य नामरूपों कर्मों और व्यवहारों में अंतर्बाह्य व्याप्त अधिष्ठान स्वरूप परमार्थ तत्त्व को देख सकता है तो फिर उसे सर्वत्र सभी परिस्थितियों में वस्तुओं और प्राणियों का दर्शन अनन्त आनन्द स्वरूप सत्य का ही स्मरण कराता है। संत पुरुष ब्रह्म का ही आह्वान करके प्रत्येक कर्म करता है इसलिये उसके सब कर्म लीन हो जाते हैं।भोजन के पूर्व इस श्लोक के पाठ का प्रयोजन अब स्वत स्पष्ट हो जाता है। शरीर धारण के लिये भोजन आवश्यक है और तीव्र क्षुधा लगने पर किसी भी प्रकार का अन्न स्वादिष्ट लगता है। इस प्रार्थना का भाव यह है कि भोजन के समय भी हमें सत्य का विस्मरण नहीं होना चाहिए। यह ध्यान रहे कि भोक्तारूप ब्रह्म ब्रह्म का आह्वान करके अन्नरूप ब्रह्म की आहुति उदर में स्थित अग्निरूप ब्रह्म को ही दे रहा है। इस ज्ञान का निरन्तर स्मरण रहने पर मनुष्य भोगों से ऊपर उठकर अपने अनन्तस्वरूप को प्राप्त कर लेता है।यज्ञ की सर्वोच्च भावना को स्पष्ट करने के पश्चात् भगवान् अर्जुन को समझाते हैं कि सम्यक् भावना के होने से किस

By entertaining such an idea the whole action melts away? as stated in the previous verse (No.23).When one attains to the knowledge of the Self or Selfrealisation his whole life becomes a wisdomsacrifice in which the oblation? the melted butter or the offering? the performer of the sacrifice? the action and the goal are all Brahman. He who meditates thus wholly upon Brahman shall verily attain to Brahman.The sage who has the knowledge of the Self knows that the oblation? the fire? the instrument by which the melted butter is poured into the fire and himself have no existence apart from that of Brahman. He who has realised through direct cognitio (Anubhava) that all is Brahman? does no action even if he performs actions. (Cf.III.15)","scetsga":"4.24 Brahma-arpanam, the ladle is Brahman: The knower of Brahman perceives the instrument with which he offers oblation in the fire as Brahman Itself. He perceives it as not existing separately from the Self, as one sees the non-existence of silver in nacre. In this sense it is that Brahman Itself is the ladle-just as what appears as silver is only narcre. (The two words brahma and arpanam are not parts of a compound word, samasa.) The meaning is that, to a knower of Brahman, what is perceived in the world as ladle is Brahman Itself. \nSimilarly, brahma-havih, the oblations is Brahman: To him, what is seen as oblations is nothing but Brahman.\nIn the same way, brahma-agnau, (-this is a compound word-) in the fire of Brahman: The fire into which oblation is hutam, poured; brahmana, by Brahman, by the agent, is Brahman Itself. The meaning is that Brahman Itself is the agent (of the offering). That he makes the offering-the act of offering-, that is also Brahman. And the result that is gantavyam, to be reached by him; that also is brahma eva, surely Brahman.\nBrahma-karma-samadhina, by him who has concentration on Brahman as the objective: Brahman Itself is the objective (karma); he who has concentration (samadhi) on That is brahma-karma-samdhih. The goal to be reached by him is Brahman alone.\nThus, even the action undertaken by one who desires to prevent mankind from going astray is in reality inaction, for it has been sublated by the realization of Brahman. This being so, in the case of the monk from whom aciton has dropped off, who has renounced all activity, viewing his Knowledge as a (kind of) sacrifice, too, becomes all the more justifiable from the point of view of praising full realization.\nThat is, whatever is well known as ladle etc. in the context of a sacrifice, all that, in the context of the Self, is Brahman Itself to one who has realized the supreme Truth. If not so, then, since all in Brahman, it would have been uselesss to specifically mention ladle etc. as Brahman. Therefore, all actions cease to exist for the man of realization who knows that Brahman Itself is all this. And this follows also from the absence (in him) of the idea of accessories. [See note on p.211.-Tr.] For the act called sacarifice is not seen to exist without being in association with the idea of accessories. All such acts as Agnihotra etc. are associated with the ideas of such accessories as making an offering etc. to the particular gods who are revealed in the scriptures, and with the idea of agentship as also desire for results. But they are not found bereft of the ideas of such distinctions as exist among action, accessories and results, or unassociated with the ideas of agentship hankering for results.\nThis (apparent) (activity of the man of Knowledge), however, stands dissociated from the ideas of differences among the accessories like ladle etc., actions and results, which get destroyed by the Knowledge of Brahman. Hence, it is inaction to be sure.\nAnd thus has it been shown in, He who finds inaction in action (18), he really does not do anything even though engaged in action (20), the organs act on the objects of the organs (3.28), Remaining absorbed in the Self, the knower of Reality should think, I certainly do not do anything (5.8), etc. While pointing out thus, the Lord demolishes in various places the ideas of differences among actions, accessories and results. And it is also seen in the case of rites such as Agnihotra undertaken for results (kamya), that the Agnihotra etc. cease to be (kamya) rites undertaken for selfish motives when the desire for their results is destroyed. Similarly, it is seen that actions done intentionally and unintentionally yeild different results. So, here as well, in the case of one who has his ideas of distinctions among accessories like ladle etc., actions and results eliminated by the knowledge of Brahman, even activites which are merely external movements amount to inaction. Hence it was said, gets totally destroyed.\nHere some say: That which is Brahman is the ladle etc. It is surely Brahman Itself which exists in the five forms [Asscessories that can be indicated by the five grammatical case-ending, viz Nominative, Objective, Instrumental, Dative and Locative. (As for instance, the sacrificer, oblation, ladle, sacrificial fire, and Brahman.-Tr.) of accessories such as the ladle etc. and it is Itself which undertakes actions. There the ideas of ladle etc. are not eradicated, but the idea of Brahman is attributed to the ladle etc. as one does the ideas of Visnu etc. to images etc., or as one does the idea of Brahman ot name etc.\nReply: True, this could have been so as well if the context were not meant for the praise of jnanayajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice). Here, however, after presenting full realization as expressed by the word jnana-yajna, and the varieties of rites as referred to by the word yajna (sacrifice), Knowledge has been praised by the Lord in, Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials (33). And in the present context, this statement, the ladle is Brahman etc., is capable of presenting Knowledge as a sacrifice; otherwise, since Brahman is everything, it will be purposeless to speak specially only of ladle etc. as Brahman. But those who maintain that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc., like superimposing the idea of Visnu and others on images etc. and of Brahman on name etc., for them the knowledge of Brahma stated (in the verse) cannot be the intended subject-matter dealt with here, because according to them ladle etc. are the (primary) objects of knowledge (in the context of the present verse).\nBesides, knowledge in the form of superimposition of an idea cannot lead to Liberation as its result; and what is said here is, Brahman alone in to be realized by him. Also, it is inconsistent to maintain that the result of Liberation can be achieved without full realization. And it goes against the context-the context being of full realization. This is supported by the fact that (the subject of ) full realization is introduced in the verse, He who finds inaction in action, and at the end (of this chapter) the conclusion pertains to that very subject-matter. The chapter comes to a close by eulozing full realization itself in, Jnana-yajna (Knowledge considered as a sacrifice) is greater than sacrifices reiring materials, Achieving Knowledge, one৷৷.attains supreme Peace, (39) etc. That being so, it is unjustifiable to suddenly say out of context that one has to superimpose the idea of Brahman on the ladle etc. like the superimposition of the idea of Visnu on images. Therefore this verse bears the meaing just as it has been already explained.\nAs to that, after having presented Knowledge as a sacrifice, other sacrifices also are being mentioned now in, the verses beginning with, (Other yogis undertake) sacrifice to gods alone, etc., for eulogizing that Knowledge:","scetdss":"4.24 Brahmarpanam etc. That is to be offered to the Brahman (list) : that, the offering of which is in the Brahman i.e., the reentrance of which is only into That, just from which it has originated. The Brahman (2nd) : That which is the same as the entire universe what we see - this is that very oblation. Into the Brahman-fire : into the fire which is the same as the Brahman, the highly tranil Supreme Consciousness. By the Brahman : by one or the other action. Is poured : is offered for the augmentation of Its lumination. Hence, a man of Yoga, whose Brahman-action of this sort is itself a deep concentration - by him, the Brahman alone is [a goal] to be attained i.e., to be realised, not anything else; for there is no other thing.\n \nAlternatively [in the verse] the meaning by him brings in, by implication, the meaning by whom. So the following is the alignment [of words] : The action, in which the Brahman-oblation, intended to be an offering to a deity of the Brahman-nature, has been indeed poured into the Brahman-fire by the sacrificer, identical with the Brahman - that very Brahman-action of this sort is itself a deep contemplaiton, because it is the means to gain the innate nature of the Self. And what is attained by this Brahman-action-contemplation is the very Brahman Itself and not any other fruit. Indeed it has been maintained [by the Lord] as :\n \n The way in which men resort to Me,\n [in the same way I favour them]. (IV, II) \n \nThose, who have cultivated the nature of performing sacrifice which is nothing but Me, but of the delimited nature - they attain, therefore, the fruit of similar [limited] nature. This is different matter. But, with regard to those who have realised the nature of the sacrifice identical with Me ( the Supreme Consciousness), the Unlimited and complete; how could they be entertaining a craving for a bit of limited fruit ? This is the idea here.\n \nThus, a top secret is furnished by this and by the succeeding verses. that has been also detailed by us (Ag.) - even though our intelligence is limited - as far as our intelligence permits, by not transgressing the instructions of our preceptors. Maybe, for a person without a regular course of the oral tradition [of the system], this looks like a picture painted on the sky and does not appeal to his mind. On that account we should not be blamed.\n \nIt has been declared by some, in this context, that [here in this verse] the oblation, the fire and the instruments like sruk [used for offering the oblation into the fire in the sacrifice] and also the act [of offering] are all adjectives alifying the Brahmam. This [explanation] deserves to be ignored. For, these commentators have not troden on the path of the secret tradition.","scetssa":"4.24 The expression Brahman is the instrument to offer with (It is to be remembered that in Ramanujas system Brahman in the primary sense is the Whole with the Supreme Being as the Soul and Atmans and Matter (Prakrti) as His body in inseparable union with the Whole. So the word Brahman can, according to the needs of each context, be used to indicate the Supreme Being, the Atman, or Prakrti; In verse 24 it has been used in all these senses. We have therefore put it in italics. See Introduction.) is adjectival to the oblation. That by which an offering is given, such as a ladle, is an Arpana. It is called Brahman because it is an effect of Brahman, Brahman being the material cause of the universe. Brahmaarpanam is the oblation, of which the instrument is Brahman. The oblation, just like the instrument with which it is offered, is also Brahman. It is offered by the agent Brahman into the fire of Brahman. He is the Brahma-karma-samadhi who contemplates thus on all acts as filled with the Supreme Brahman or as having the Supreme Brahman as the Self. He who contemplates on Brahman as the Soul of all actions, reaches Brahman alone, as his own self has the Supreme Brahman as Its Self. The meaning is that the individual self - which is Brahman because of Its having Brahman as Its Self - has to realise Its own real nature. All actions performed by an aspirant for release have the form of knowledge because of their association with the contemplation of the Supreme Brahman as their self. They are a direct means for the vision of the self without the meditation of Jnana Yoga.\nThus, Sri Krsna, after explaining how Karma takes the form of knowledge, now speaks of the various kinds of Karma Yoga.","chakravarthi":"It has been stated in the previous verse that one should perform actions for the purpose of yajna. What type of yajna is this? This verse explains. Arpanam refers to the instruments such as the wooden spoon used to offer the ghee into the fire. This is brahman. The article used as oblation is brahman. The fire in which the oblation is placed is brahman. The performer of the yajna is brahman. The person who sees things in this way attains brahman alone, not any other result. Why? Because he has concentrated his attention on the action which is composed only of brahman (brahma karma samadhina).","rudra":"\nThe actions performed by a person as offerings and worship to the Supreme\nLord Krishna are considered inaction as they lead to spiritual intelligence\nand are not bonded in any way to reactions. For one who has achieved atma\ntattva or soul realisation all actions are neutralised by knowing that one\nis not the doer and hence for them even various natural actions are\nconsidered inaction. The transformation of action to inaction due to\nabsence of egoism was previously explained in verse 18. Now Lord Krishna is\nstating that the transformation of action to inaction is always present in\nthe person who performs all their actions in relation to the Brahman or the\nspiritual substratum pervading all existence. One whose mind is absorbed in\nperforming all actions as offerings to the Brahman exclusively, attains the\nBrahman without a doubt.","brahma":"\nThe essential meaning Lord Krishna is conveying here is the establishing of\na higher consciousness that sees all activities as offerings to the Brahman\nor the spiritual substratum pervading all existence. Everything is spoken\nas the Brahman because everything is emanated from the Brahman and\neverything is contained within the Brahman. It should not be assumed that\nthe unlimited myriad of individual beings are in the likeness of the\nBrahman because that would be erroneous. The Brahman is the whole and all\nothers are infinitesimal parts of the whole and subservient to it because\nall comes into existence from the Brahman. In the Padma Purana the sages\nspeak that: The Supreme Lord is verily is the essence and the total of the\nVedas. Everything is verily the vision of the Supreme Lords consciousness\nand the Brahman is the manifestation of this consciousness. With the\nequanimity of ones intellect Brahman is realised to be the performer of\nall actions.\nNow begins the summation.\nHow can pride be relinquished? By offering pride to the Brahman along with\nother unwanted hindrances. The paraphernalia offered to the Brahman is\ncalled Brahmarpanamas and they include the fire itself, the ghee or\nclarified butter and foodgrains offered to the sacred fire as well as the\nperformer of the yagna or worship who propitiates the Supreme Lord by\noffering oblations. So the Brahman is also the performing presribed Vedic\nactions with equanimity in higher consciousness. But even with this\nequanimity all are eternally subservient to the Supreme Lord. The\nMahabharata confirms that only the respendent Supreme Lord Krishna is\nindependent everything else is dependent upon Him.","shri":"\nHere the word brahmarpanam means the paraphernalia used to offer oblations\nin yagna or offering of worship to propitiate the Supreme Lord.
