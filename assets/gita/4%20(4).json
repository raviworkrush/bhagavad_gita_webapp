How am I to understand this that You instructed (him) in the beginning?","etssa":"4.4 Arjuna said Later on was Thy birth, and prior to it was the birth of Vivasvan (the Sun); how am I to understand that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning?","etdss":"4.4. Arjuna said Your birth is later, [while] the birth of Vivasvat is earlier; how am then to understand that You had properly taught [him this] in the beginnig ?","ecssa":"4.4 अपरम् later? भवतः Thy? जन्म birth? परम् prior? जन्म birth? विवस्वतः of Vivasvan? कथम् how? एतत् this? विजानीयाम् am I to understand? त्वम् Thou? आदौ in the beginning? प्रोक्तवान् taughtest? इत thus.Commentary Thy birth took place later in the hourse of Vasudeva Vivasvan or Vivasvat (the Sun) was born earlier in the beginning of evolution. How am I to believe that Thou taughtest this Yoga in the beginning to Vivasvan? and that Thou? the selfsame person? hast now taught it to me I am not able to reconcile this. Be kind enought to enlighten me? O my Lord.","scetsga":"4.4 Bhavatah, Your; janma, was aparam, later, in the abode of Vasudeva; (whereas) the birth vivasvatah, of Visvasvan, the Sun; was param, earlier, in the beginning of creation. Therefore, katham, how; vijanyam, am I to understand; etat, this, as not inconsistent; iti, that; tvam, You, yourself; who proktavan, insturcted this Yoga; adau, in the beginning, are the same person who are now teaching me?\nBy way of demolishing the doubt of fools with regard to Vasudeva, that He has no God-hood and omniscience-to which very purpose was Arjunas estion-","scetdss":"4.4 Even though he knows the nature of the Lord, Arjuna asks this estion in order to publisize it to the world.","scetssa":"4.4 Arjuna said According to the calculation of time, your birth was indeed later, contemporaneous with our births. And the birth of Vivasvan was at an earlier time, reckoned as twenty-eight cycles of units of four Yugas each. How can I understand as true that you taught it in the beginning?\nNow, there is no contradiction here, for it was ite possible that He had taught Vivasvan in a former birth. The memory of what was done in former births is ite natural for great men. This should not be taken to mean that Arjuna does not know the son of Vasudeva, the speaker, as the Lord of all. Because he (Arjuna) says later on: You are the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Light and the Supreme Purifier. All the seers proclaim You as the eternal Divine Purusa, the Primal Lord, unborn and all-pervading. So also proclaim the divine sage Narada, Asita, Devala and Vyasa. You Yourself also are saying this to me (10.12-13.)\nArjuna had heard repeatedly from Bhisma and others during the Rajasuya sacrifice of Yudhisthira, Krsna alone is the cause of creation and submergence of all the worlds. This universe, consisting of things both animate and inanimate, was created for the sake of Krsna (Ma. Bha., 2.38.23) The entire universe is subservient to Krsna is the meaning of For the sake of Krnsa.\nThis apparent contradiction may be explained as follows: Arjuna surely knows the son of Vasudeva as the Bhagavan. Though knowing Him as such, he estions as if he did not know Him. This is his intention. Can the birth of the Lord of all, who is antagonistic to all that is evil and wholly auspicious, omniscient, whose will is always true and whose desires are fulfilled - can the birth of such a Person be of the same nature as that of the gods, men etc., who are subject to Karma? Or can it be false like the illusions of a magical show? Or could it be real? In other words, is the birth of the Supreme Being as the incarnate a real fact or a mere illusory phenomenon produced by a magicians art? If His birth is real, what is the mode of His birth? What is the nature of His body? What is the manner of His birth? What is the nature of this body of His? What is the casue of His birth? To what end is He born? The way in which Sri Krsna answers Arjunas estion, justifies the construing of his estion in this way.","chakravarthi":"In this verse, Arjuna asks about the impossibility of what Krishna has just spoken. “Your birth is recent (aparam) and Vivasvan’s birth is ancient (param). How can I understand that you spoke it to him?”","rudra":"\nConsidering the possibility of Visvavan being instructed 120 million years\npreviously by the same Lord Krishna as He is standing before him, Arjuna\nasks the Lord to explain just how it was that He taught this eternal yoga\nor the science of the individual consciousness attaining communion with the\nultimate consciousness to Visvavan, the demigod of the sun.","brahma":"\nThis question is asked in relation to Lord Krishnas earlier declaration in\nchapter III.XXX mayi sarvani karmani meaning to offer all activities to\nHim.\nNow begins the summation.\nThe purpose of inquiry from men of wisdom as given in the Agni Purana has a\ndual purpose. First is reconfirmation of the knowledge of eternal\nprinciples that they already possess. Second is that their explanations\noffer additional clarification. In this same way these questions asked to\nLord Krishna should be understood in this manner. One should be aware that\nArjuna was not a novice bereft of Vedic knowledge, he had been to the\nheavenly planets and had received instuctions from his father Indra the\nchief of the celestials. He also had never broken his vows and was never\ndefeated in battle. So he was not an ordinary being and was somewhat\ncognizant of Lord Krishna supreme position.","shri":"\nThe sun-god Visvavan had duly received the Bhagavad-Gita from Lord Krishna\n120 million years previously; yet he was Arjunas contemporary; so an\nexplanation of this anomalous anachronism is being requested. One may\nquestion what is the purpose to ask this from one who is aware of Lord\nKrishnas supreme position for it is known that even saintly and noble\nsouls remember events from previous incarnations. Also before when the\nPandava king Yudhisthira performed the Rajasuya ceremony the grandsire\nBhishma was heard to say that Lord Krishna alone is the origin of all\ncreated beings and the beginning and the ending of all movable and\nimmovable beings. So the reason Arjuna asked such a question was to get\nclarification presented in an exposition on the meaning of avatars or Lord\nKrishnas authorised incarnations in the Vedic scriptures and answer these\nquestions.\n1) Are avatars real or illusory?\n2) Under what circumstances do avatars manifest?\n3) What is the nature of the body the avatar assumes?\n4) Are all the avatars expanding from Lord Krishna?\n5) Are all the avatars omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent?\n6) Are all avatars transcendental to the cycle of birth and death?\n7) Are all avatars able to fulfill all desires?\n8) What is the time schedule which avatars manifest themselves?\nThis was the purpose of this question so Lord Krishna would give an expose\non these topics.","kumar":"The sun-god Visvavan had duly received the Bhagavad-Gita from Lord Krishna\n120 million years previously; yet he was Arjunas contemporary; so an\nexplanation of this anomalous anachronism is being requested.
