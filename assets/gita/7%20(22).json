","etssa":"7.22 Endowed with that faith, he engages in the worship of that (form) and from it he obtains his desire, these being verily ordained by Me (alone). ","etdss":"7.22. Endowed with that faith, he seeks to worship that deity and therefrom receives his desired objects that are ordained by none but Me.

Hitan meaning benefits. This is another interpretation. The devotee who worships the lesser gods attains the objects of his desire (minor psychic powers? etc.). Those objects are ordained by the Lord only as He alone knows exactly the relation between the actions and their results or rewards and as He is the Inner Ruler of all beings. Unwise or undiscriminating people only take recourse to the means of getting these finite rewards which can hardly give entire satisfaction. Pitiable indeed is their lot They have,no power of eniry (VicharaSakti) or right understanding. They get hold of pieces of glass instead of attaining the jewel of the Self? of incalculabe value. ","scetsga":"7.22 Yuktah,being endued; taya, with that; sraddhaya, faith, as granted by Me; sah, that person; ihate, engages in; radhanam, i.e. aradhanam, worshipping; tasyah, that form of the deity. And labhate, he gets; tan hi, those very; kaman, desired results; tatah, there-from, from that form of the deity which was worshipped; as vihitan, they are dispensed, meted out; maya eva, by Me alone, who am the omniscient, supreme God, because I am possessed of the knowledge of the apportionment of the results of actions.\nThe meaning his that he surely gets those desired results since they are ordained by God.\nIf the reading be hitan (instead of hi tan), then the beneficence (-hita means beneficent-) of the desired result should be interpreted in a figurative sense, for desires cannot be beneficial to anyone!

Thence, i.e., from the worship of Indra and other divinities, who constitute My body, he attains the objects of his desire, which are in reality granted by Me alone. Although he does not know at the time of worship that divinities like Indra, who are his objects of worship, are My body only, and that worship of them is My worship, still, inasmuch as this worship is, in reality, My worship, he attains his objects of desire granted by Me alone. ","chakravarthi":"That person, endowed with that faith, performs (ihate) worship of that devata. He obtains the results of that worship (kaman) from the worship of that particular devata.
